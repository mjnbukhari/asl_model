# ASL Gesture Recognition using CNN

A machine learning project for American Sign Language (ASL) recognition using TensorFlow. The model classifies 29 distinct hand gestures from image data using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Features

- Preprocessed over 80,000 images using OpenCV
- High-accuracy CNN with dropout to prevent overfitting
- Converted to `.tflite` for mobile deployment
- Built with Keras and TensorFlow
